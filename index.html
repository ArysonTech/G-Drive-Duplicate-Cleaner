<h1>Aryson Google Drive Duplicate Cleaner</h1>

<p>
Aryson Google Drive Duplicate Cleaner is a web-based application that helps users
scan, identify, and manage duplicate files within their own Google Drive account.
</p>

<p>
The application requires users to sign in with Google and grant explicit permission
before accessing any Google Drive data. The app uses the Google Drive API only to
analyze file metadata and content to detect duplicates.
</p>

<p>
Based on user confirmation, duplicate files can be moved to trash or permanently
deleted. No actions are performed without explicit user consent.
</p>

<p>
The application does not store Google Drive data on external servers and does not
share user data with any third parties.
